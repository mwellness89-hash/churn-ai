OPTION B: MANAGED CHURN REDUCTION → MULTI-BILLION

I commit to:
✅ Week 1: MVP + landing page ready (DONE TODAY)
✅ Week 2: 20+ founder DMs sent, 2-3 calls booked
✅ Week 6: First customer signed ($5K/month)
✅ Week 12: 3-5 customers ($25K-$50K MRR)
✅ Year 1: 20 customers ($3M ARR)

When this gets hard (Month 3-8):
- I will look at bank account: $25K MRR = freedom
- I will talk to happy customers: "You saved us $150K churn"
- I will keep going

I will NOT:
❌ Pivot before week 12 ("maybe I should build X instead")
❌ Get distracted by "infrastructure first" dreams
❌ Build features instead of selling

If by Month 12 I have 0 customers → I've earned the right to pivot.
If by Month 12 I have 3-5 customers → I scale this to $100M+.
